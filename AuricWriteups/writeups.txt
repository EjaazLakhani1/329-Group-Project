Introduction on Web Exploitation Section

Question 1

- Take a look at the first section where frontend and backend are discussed
- See that three frontend tools are listed (Html, Css, Javascript)
- See that HTML is used for text, and CSS is used for style 
- Finally see that Javascript adds animations 
- So the answer is Javascript


Question 2

- Recall that in the lesson sensitive informaiton was described as information that is private in nature
- Look in third section that corresponds to dangers of vulnurable websites
- See the part in that section that discusses sensitive information
- Look at the three types of infomaiton in brackets "addresses, names, phone numbers"
- These are your answers


Basic Techniques of Web Exploitation Section

Question 1

- Look at the three different types of exploitation technique sections
- Which section would allow us to find a hidden password
- Neither Developer tools or brute force attacks explicitly talk about hidden files
- Path Traversal section states that you can use this technique to find hidden directories with sensitive files/folders
- So "Path Traversals" is the correct answer


Question 2

- This question is more based off of general knowledge about this project entirely
- All the information learned in this section and the other sections is potentially dangerous if used maliciously
- So in which way should you use what you have learned?
- The answer is "Ethically"


Deep Dive into Dev Tools Section

Question 1

- By looking in the last section (What to look for), you can see that the main focuses are the "Elements" and "Sources" Tabs
- The elements tab holds the html code for the current webpage (so it cant be here)
- What does the Sources tab hold?
- It holds all of the files that were used to make the webpage
- This is the section we can find exploitable files infomaiton
- So the answer is "Sources"

Question 2

- This question is a simple reading question (sort of a trick question)
- The setup part of this section holds the answer
- Even though "Chrome" is put in brackets the section clearly states that any web browser can be used
- So "Google Chrome", "Microsoft Edge", and "Firefox" are all true
- Therefore "d" (All of the above), is the answer





CTF QUESTIONS

Question 1

- Solution comes directly from lesson notes
- Specifically when its stated that sometimes the creator leaves vulnurable shortcuts for their convience that they forget to remove
- The paragraph in the middle of the page is the creator stating that they made a page with their password 
- Looking in the bottom left a password labeled "Unfinished page" is seen
- When clicked, you are redirected to a webpage with a obviously clickable button titled "Whats my password again?"
- Once this button is clicked the flag appears in a notification (only include the text after “flag” to correctly answer the questions)
- flag is {flag}UnsafeWebsite


Question 2

- Solution comes from second section with multiple descriptions of web exploitation Techniques
- The landing page of this website has a login form and some text and buttons on the left side of the screen
- Attempting to type in any incorrect password displays an invalid username/password notification
- It is needed to click on the right technique to breach a login (Brute Force in this situation)
- After clicking on the Brute Force button, a notification appears with what was done as well as a username and password
- Typing these credentials into the login form causes a notification with the flag to pop up
- Note: Only copy texty inside {} to answer correctly
- flag is flag{N1C3_S6R1PT1N6}


Question 3

- The homepage looks decivingly simple for this question
- Developer tools needs to be used here to find the flag (as third section deep dives into this technique)
- First it is needed to actually open the developer console (easiest way is to right click and select inspect)
- Now the html code is visible and by reading this code and a comment message "Hopefully I remembered to remove my ‘secretCode’ from that one file" is visible
- Now the user needs to go to the source tab (to find hidden file)
- After searching a file named "special.js" can be found and after clicking a lot of code appears
- Now it is needed to use the searchbar (at the bottom of window or ctrl + f) 
- Searching for "flag" or "secretCode" (the keyword given) will direct you to the flag
- flag is flag{S0RC3_0F_A11_3V1L}
