Tools & Terminal Commands & Information to get started Section

Question 1

- We know from the example that chmod +<permission> adds the permission to the files
- Therefore to remove a permission we will use chmod -<permission>
- So to remove reading from a file it will be "chmod -r <filename>"

Question 2

- Using the link provided https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=s-strings-command and look at Example 2.
- Use the same format, we get the answer of "strings -6 <filename>"


Intro to assembly Section

Question 1

Looking at Figure 1:
    - Move stores a value into the register thus at line 1 ebx = 6 and on line 2 ecx = 4
    - Add adds two registers together thus "add ebx, ecx" does ebx = ebx + ecx so at line 3 ebx = 6 + 4 and ebx = 10
    - On line 4 eax = 2
    - sub subtracts two registers together thus "sub ebx, eax" does ebx = ebx - eax so at line 5 ebx = 10 + 2 and ebx = 8
    - So the final answer is 8


Question 2

Looking at Figure 2:
    - Move stores a value into the register thus at line 1 ebx = 4 and on line 2 ecx = 1
    - cmp compares ebx and ecx, since the next line is jg L2 using the file provided we can
    see that jg checks if ebx > ecx. Since jg checks if ebx > ecx and this is true because
    4 > 1 then the code jumps to L2 and we continue at "sub ebx, ecx"
    - sub subtracts two registers together thus "sub ebx, ecx" does ebx = ebx - ecx so at line 5 ebx = 4 - 1 and ebx = 3
    - Move stores a value into the register thus at the final line eax = ebx, thus eax = 3


CTF QUESTIONS

Question 1
- All we have to do to find the flag is look at the source code of the final to find the flag
"cpscCTF{4lw4y5_ch3ck_50urc3_c0d3}"

Question 2
- We can see that the secretHash has a set of {}, thus this must be the flag encrypted
- Changing the function being called at the bottom of the code from "makeRandomPassword()" to "decode(secretHash)"
and then running the file will decrypt the hash and give the flag which is "cpscCTF{d3c0d1n6_1s_fun}"

Question 3
- Open the executable file with Cutter with "cutter vault" in the terminal
- Find the bank function in the file
- There will be a bunch of 1 letter strings one line after another, which if you connect makes the word "f4ncy_pa5sword"
- Surround this word with cpscCTF{} and you get cpscCTF{f4ncy_pa5sword} as the flag
